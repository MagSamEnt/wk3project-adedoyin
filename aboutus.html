	<h3>Our Skills as  Developers</h3>

<p>While technical skills, or hard skills, are essential for developers, We know that it is  important to hone our soft skills as well. Here are a few that are helping as  in this field:</p>

  <h3>  Problem-solving capabilities</h3>

   <p> Most software is designed to provide a solution to a problem. We as Software developers are able to identify the issue that a piece of software aims to remedy and build software that solves the problem. We have the  capabilities to address any issues that come up during the development process or to work out bugs.</p>

    <h3>Communication skills</h3>

   <p> We are team of programmers, which means we are able to clearly communicate expectations and talk through solutions. Additionally, we are responsible for providing detailed reports on the development process to executives who likely do not have a technology background.</p>

   <h3> Analytical thinking</h3>

   <p> When building software, as a developer we constantly analyze the state of the software and its code. As we do this, we determine whether the software is likely to achieve its goal. Analysis is also needed during the design process to conceptualize something that solves the unique challenges facing our clients or the end users.</p>

   <h3> Patience</h3>

<p>Patience is an important soft skill for us as software developers because the development process can be lengthy and, at times, quite complex. Patience help us to keep our motivation going strong amid setbacks or an evolving scope of work. Patience is also an essential tool for developing and maintaining strong interpersonal relationships, especially in potentially trying situations such as working against deadlines or getting a new hire up to speed in the middle of a project.</p>

   <h3> Emotional intelligence</h3>

    <p>When unforeseen circumstances threaten to derail our progress or distract us from achieving organizational goals, emotional intelligence helps us to remain calm and focused. A high degree of emotional intelligence, when used effectively, can help defuse emotionally charged situations, find points of commonality, compromise with our teammates or enable us to communicate better as we try to understand the challenges our peers might be facing.
